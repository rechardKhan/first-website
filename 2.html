CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation
of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according
to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done
synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard
about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.
